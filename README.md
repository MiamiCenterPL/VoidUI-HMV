This VoidUI addon aims at bringing this very distinct color pallete known from Hotline Miami to PAYDAY 2 while using Void UI as your HUD, moreover this addon gives huge amount of freedoom if it comes to personalization. You as an player can quickly change overall color pallete or fiddle with every individual setting and make gaming experience truely yours.
You can find all available settings for this mod inside VoidUI's options menu. This addon works with my other mod - ![VoidUI-Infoboxes](https://github.com/MiamiCenterPL/VoidUI-InfoBoxes) perfectly fine aswel!
